# Labseq Challenge

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

The following text represents the steps taken to reach the final product.

## Installing Quarkus

Following the guide provided in the website: https://quarkus.io/get-started/, the Quarkus CLI was installed for Windows using:

```shell script
iex "& { $(iwr https://ps.jbang.dev) } trust add https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/quarkus/quarkus-cli/"
```

```shell script
iex "& { $(iwr https://ps.jbang.dev) } app install --fresh --force quarkus@quarkusio"
```

## Starting Application

Download the code in the repository. After that, open a terminal within that folder and run the following command.  

```shell script
quarkus dev
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is the only step required to execute this application.

## Backend - Creating the Quarkus application

After installing the CLI, the next step is to create an application. This can be done by using the following command:

```shell script
quarkus create labseq
```
> [!NOTE]
> Not required if the application is already created.

With the application created, enter its directory `labseq` and run it using the following command:

```shell script
quarkus dev
```

or alternatively, if `Maven` is installed and configured:

```shell script
mvn compile quarkus:dev
```
> [!NOTE]
> To configure maven, follow the README file bundled with the maven download or this guide for Windows https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-maven-windows.

The Quarkus app is now running at http://localhost:8080.

Inserting the number in the number box of the GUI and pressing `Calculate` will make a call to the service and the result will appear.

## Frontend - Creating GUI using HTML and JavaScript

HTML and JavaScript were used to create the frontend of the service, directly in the `index.html` file.

```html
<h2>Labseq Challenge</h2>

<p>Insert number to calculate (Must be positive and integer)</p>
<input id="num" type="number" style="margin-right: 2ch;">
<button onclick="calculateNum()">Calculate</button>

<script>
function calculateNum() {
    var num = document.getElementById("num").value;
    var solution = "labseq/".concat(num);
    window.location.pathname = solution;
}
</script>
```

The only purpose of this GUI is to call the service via its **endpoint**.

It is presented when accessing http://localhost:8080.

## REST API Documentation

An account was created in `SwaggerHub` to be able to use the web application.

To expose the Open API Specifications this guide was used: https://quarkus.io/guides/openapi-swaggerui.

To add the Quarkus provided Smallrye OpenAPI extension the following command was used:

```shell script
quarkus extension add 'quarkus-smallrye-openapi'
```

The next step is to add the dependency to the `pom.xml` file.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-openapi</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Run the Quarkus app.

```shell script
quarkus dev
```

Once the application has started, make a request to the endpoint: 

http://localhost:8080/q/openapi

This results in a file named `openapi`. This file is then added to SwaggerHub and synced, and merged with the Github branch.

SwaggerHub URL: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/TheDarKnight46/Labseq/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

> [!IMPORTANT]
> From this point on, the thought process used while developing will be explained. The Solution found is at the end

## Creating the Java code

When it came to the programming side of the challenge it was first required that the problem was understood.

By analyzing the provided document, the main takeaways from the challenge were the following:
- Implement a REST Service, using the Quarkus Java Framework;
- This service returned a value from the labseq sequence;
- The way the sequence of values works if defined by:
    - n=0 -> l(0) = 0
    - n=1 -> l(1) = 1
    - n=2 -> l(2) = 0 
    - n=3 -> l(3) = 1 
    - n>3 -> l(n) = l(n-4) + l(n-3)
- The endpoint created should be in the form `<baseurl>/labseq/{n}` where `n` represents the index of the sequenceâ€™s value to return;
- The implemented service should use a caching mechanism;
- The calculation of `l(10000)` must be correctly returned in under 10s.

### Understanding the sequence

To understand how the sequence works, firstly some by hand calculations were performed. It became clear that larger numbers were calculated by slowly reducing their size until they were either 0,1,2 or 3.

Caching was an important step since by saving the result of already calculated `l(n)` the processing load and time required would be cut **tremendously**.

The best way to store data like this is by using a **Map** where the '*keys*' are the values of `n` and the '*values*' are the result of `l(n)`. This variable is called `cache`.

### Using recursive functions

When creating the algorithm to calculate the sequence, the method of the class `Labseq` called `breakdown(int n)` is used.

```java
1  private BigInteger breakdown(int n) {
2     if (n <= 3)
3         return (n % 2 == 0) ? BigInteger.valueOf(0) : BigInteger.valueOf(1); 
4     else {
5         BigInteger cachedNum = cache.get(n);
6         if (cachedNum != null)
7             return cachedNum;   
8
9         BigInteger result = breakdown(n-4).add(breakdown(n-3)); 
10        cacheValue(n, result);
11        return result;
12    }
13 }
```

This method is being used recursively.

It first checks if `n<=3`, as seen in line 3. 

- If so it gives the direct answer as provided by the source document.
- If it is not, then the formula `l(n-4) + l(n-3)` is applied, calling `breakdown(int n)` recursively with the new values of `n`.

> [!NOTE]
> This formula implementation can be seen in line 9. Since its a BigInteger it is required to use the add() method to perform a sum.

When a result is calculated, the `cacheValue(int key, BigInteger value)` method is used to add it to the `cache` **Map**.

### Caching data

When the recursive function ends, it goes back and adds the value to the map using its respective *keys* and *values*.

For this to work though, it requires the method `breakdown(int n)` to check the **Map** every time it is executed, looking within the `cache` for the respective *key*.

If it finds the *key*, then the *value* is returned immediately, otherwise the execution continues as previously explained.

## Solution

The solution to the the function `l(10000)` is presented below.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the size of the result, the code had to be adapted to use BigInteger (32 bit) so that the number could be calculated properly.

**l(10000) = 69950566878097184013157744477635556727868849589082998911839343197880823215346221009722233023943602770307729191665655398407165768121564186987192397693071609846919453430811144389823875683774480880281479951416523467736343974525549960389427464841013320746241755697990287429747307066048835194835534301361435435171244963037487135503198565459610125773779110841477593382691667903942271834984619627946845583317271714790127086723614783681640902031022970893247841818337935296805019561967546398282596597404334400595273408222818081762762981879844447410743730739725556081175617700994424267694361314464204552899258977619983936670456553201627025301979470684612183482967552781789171894406131379502874476544298881442363169258726593616997962614541232149734611181684936265928412294383549494959124156102645749161099774806409315657803977415799277767229630141831326718534674913706653355139**
